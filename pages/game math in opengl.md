- LATER do camera chapter
- LATER do game project in c++
- I could swap to c++ when I do the game section for breakout.
	- I should probably stick to c, I feel like I would be changing it up too quick. Maybe? I really don't know if I should keep using C or swap to C++. The fact that I don't know probably means I should stick with C, right? People say you should write C++ with just simple classes, only one level of inheritance, and only simple templates. Then you get the benefit of wrapping methods and data in classes without C++ code that is too complicated.
