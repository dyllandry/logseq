- language is TypeScript so I can focus on learning SMQ, and so I can combine everything later into the school app project more quickly.
- architecture
	- message_sender_app: sends messages onto `queue_a` & `queue_b`
	- message_consumer_app_A: reads off `queue_a`, does fake long process
	- message_consumer_app_B: reads of `queue_b`, does fake long process
- todo
	- LATER setup SMQ
	- LATER setup `queue_a`
	- LATER setup `queue_b`
