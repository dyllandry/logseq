	- I'd like to do small manageable projects instead of large ones. I don't want to bottleneck anything.
		- I could build a larger project with each increment.
	- Tech I want to use:
		- simple message queue (SMQ) on AWS
			- sender_app_1: sends messages
		- prisma ORM
		- graphql api
		- docker
		- k8s
		- unit tests, e2e tests
