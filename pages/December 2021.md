- LATER decide on web projects for portfolio
	- I'd like to do small manageable projects instead of large ones. I don't want to bottleneck anything.
		- I could build a larger project with each increment.
	- Tech I want to use:
		- simple message queue (SMQ) on AWS
			- sender_app_1: sends messages onto queues 1 & 2
			- consumer_app_1: reads off queue 1, does fake long process
			- consumer_app_2: reads of queue 2, does fake long process
		- prisma ORM
			- student, class, teacher db w/ migrations, seeding
		- graphql api
			- on top of the school prisma ORM project
		- docker
			- applied to school prisma ORM project
		- k8s
			- school api can schedule report cards to be generated & sent to students
		- unit tests, e2e tests
- LATER decide on criteria for new web job
