- It might be good to do a project that is typescript CICD w/ tests and deployment
	- description of different kinds of tests [link](https://stackoverflow.com/a/859592)
	- could be an online string calculator in typescript
		- reverse strings
		- break a string into individual characters
		- camel case a string
		- snake case a string
	- runs unit tests, and deploys if it passes
- I'm getting stressed out about the big lms project. Maybe I should stick to smaller deliverables. I don't know.
	- maybe I ought to worry less about whether or not I'll finish it and instead just work little by little to complete it. Worst case scenario, I don't complete it, but I post what i have so far and write what's left to do.
- I can also start interview prep too, that seems fun.
- Maybe I should set up habits for all this stuff to make sure I get around to all of it bit by bit
