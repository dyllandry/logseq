- LATER make a habit tracker
	- include habits:
		- work on primary projects (LMS)
		- work on secondary projects (interview prep, portfolio site)
		- apply to jobs
		- not MB in morning or night
		- get 8 hours of sleep
		- get out of bed at 7
- For interview prep, I should do it in two different languages, in case the interviewer doesn't want to see it in one of the languages.
	- maybe python & c++?
